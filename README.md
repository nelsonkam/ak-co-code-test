ak&co code test
===============

## How to run the project

The project is a simple html + css project and as such any static web server can be used to run it. I recommend using `serve` which can be installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nelsonkam/ak-co-code-test.git
$ npm install -g serve
$ cd ak-co-code-test
$ serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and you're done !
